# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction
---

## Overview

This project explores the **Titanic dataset** to demonstrate a complete **machine learning workflow**, with a strong focus on **data preprocessing**.
The dataset is cleaned, transformed, and prepared before applying a **regression model** , **KNN_moddel** to predict passenger survival.

---

## What This Project Does

* Preprocesses real-world Titanic data
* Handles missing values and categorical features
* Applies feature scaling
* Splits data into training and testing sets
* Trains a Multiple Linear Regression model
* Generates survival predictions

---

## Why This Project

The goal of this project is to **understand how raw data becomes model-ready**.
Linear Regression is used for learning purposes to highlight the importance of **model selection** in machine learning.
